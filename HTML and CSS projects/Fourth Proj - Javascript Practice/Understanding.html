            <p id=First>With these paragraphs, I am showing padding. All the extra yellow space within the borders is considered padding. <br>
            I want to work on being able to adjust and alter information in different ways. When sizing, changing margins, adding or removing padding, and moving positions, I've been making educated guesses. I hope to practice this and understand this aspect a bit more, so it's not such a guess.</p>

            <p id=Second>With these paragraphs, I'm showing margins.<br>This photo is a picture of the street signs on my corner. I took the picture last year during the mid-summer. I'm pretty sure it was after my Europe trip. I used a photo-editing program to alter the saturation, the color/hue, and the filter. I like using photography and editing software to create works of art with everyday sort of scenes and objects. It's interesting to see something we see all the time in a different or unusual way.</p>
            <p id=Second>I am showing margins with these. The white space between these two boxes are created by Margins. The extra tan space is the result of padding.</p>

            <p class="DropCap"> <span>O</span>nce upon a time... I was up way too late messing with code and now I'm attempting a Drop Cap to start off this paragraph and totally not doing what I have intended on this page right now. That's okay though. But I'm having a hard time working on floating text, instead of floating an image. The End.</p>
