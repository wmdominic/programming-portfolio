            <p>My boyfriend, Jeremy, is an extremely smart and super sweet person. I am glad he's so open in showing and including me in his interests and hobbies. I'm so happy his incorporating me into his life. It makes me feel cared for and wanted. He's so amazing.</p>
            <p>I'm super thankful for him encouraging me to learn a little bit of coding. I have definitely gotten more insight into it and into how smart he is. I truly appreciate everything he does because being able to code as quickly and efficiently as he does, the amount of information he has when it comes to doing this on a daily basis, and the crazy amount of skill he has to do this... You're super amazing babe. </p>

            <h3>What I like about my Boyfriend</h3>
            <p>First, I really like how understanding he is. Jeremy is always finding ways to make sure I'm happy and knows how I'm feeling. That's another important aspect about him I like is his ability to have open communication. He can be so open and honest and direct, and I truly appreciate that part of him.</p>
            <p>Second, I really like how cute and adorable he is. I'm super lucky and thankful that the guys before him left him behind so I could snatch him up. I couldn't be happier and I don't want to ever let him go. He's become such an important and strong influence in my life since he came into it. Did I mention he's fucking beautiful as hell?</p>
            <p>Lastly, He has a <em>really</em> nice butt. Like, wow. He was blessed.</p>

            <h3>November 1st, 2020</h3>
            <p>Today, I woke up next to my gorgeous boyfriend. I put some pants and my sweatshirt on and went to get coffee and bagels. I came back and we ate breakfast in bed. After, we cuddled for a few minutes before he had to poop and start studying. I decided I was going to try learning code because I wanted to try doing what Jeremy does on a daily basis. This is super cool and really fun. I have a greater appreciation for all the hard work and skill my boyfriend puts into his work and school. He's so awesome.</p>

            <h3>Words that Accurately Describe Jeremy Krovitz (with definitions and examples)</h3>
            <dl>
                <dt>Considerate</dt>
                <dd>Showing concern for the feelings and needs of other people.</dd>
                <dd>Example: When he asked if I needed anything when I was having a bad day, and when he asks how I'm doing, even when I'm having a great day. Jeremy always checks to see if I'm happy and content.</dd>
                
                <dt>Inventive</dt>
                <dd>Showing individualism and creativity in thought or action.</dd>
                <dd>Example: Jeremy is always finding smart and innovative ways to tackle a problem and is willing to find a solution that makes sense and works out for everyone while maintaining uniqueness in his answer.</dd>
                
                <dt>Rational</dt>
                <dd>Guided by experience and observation rather than theory or opinion.</dd>
                <dd>Example: The Coronavirus Pandemic. Need I say more? Jeremy always sanitizes, washes his hands, wears his mask(s), keeps the pandemic in the front of his mind, watches the stats and legislation surrounding COVID-19, takes items from the back of the shelf rather than the one "everyone's dicked with", and keep others in check for their safety as well as his own.</dd>
                
                <dt>Sincere</dt>
                <dd>Open and genuine.</dd>
                <dd>Example: Another very obvious adjective to describe Jeremy. He always has a listening ear ready if I have something to say or when I have something on my mind. He never denies me the chance to speak what I need to get off my chest. He is honest and he lets me know what he has on his mind as well.</dd>
            </dl>
            
            <h3>Our First Date</h3>
            <ol class="b">
                <li>First, he picked me up from the hotel. As I sat in the lobby, I remember my heart racing like crazy and my hands shaking. I was so nervous but so excited.</li>
                <li>Then we went to the Original Pancake House and I got banana pancakes, which were super good. (It's still one of my favorite places to go.)</li>
                <li>Afterwards, he showed me around to places that hold significance to him.</li>
                <li>He showed me:
                    <ul class="b"`>
                        <li>His high school - Maple Grove Senior High - and told me about how he met his friend Beatrice and a few stories about being in high school.</li>
                        <li>St. Thomas and Macalester.</li>
                        <li>A swingset on Macalester's campus and read his essays from his writing class.</li>
                        <li>Pad Thai where he went to a lot as a student. I loved their vegetarian eggrolls.</li>
                    </ul>
                <li>After Thai food and ice cream, I think we called it a night, as it was getting late.</li>
                <li>At the end of the day, we went back to my hotel room where we watched TV and had our first kiss.</li>
                <li>It was probably the best date I've been on.</li>
            </ol>
