            <p>
                As I continued working on my coding, I started to realize <a href="FirstHTMLPage.html">my first HTML page</a> was getting to be busy. I decided to make a new page. Three things I want to do with this page are: making more complex tables, colors (outside of the basic color name code), and link my first page with this new one.
            </p>
            <p>
                I think there's also a couple more things in the book coming up I want to apply to this page too. I believe objects are coming as well. This is my "advanced page" for my coding stuff. :o)
