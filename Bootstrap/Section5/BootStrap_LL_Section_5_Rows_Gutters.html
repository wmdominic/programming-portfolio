        <!--Rows are designed to be column containers. When using containers, extra margin is implemented to provide space so containers do not mesh together. The row eliminates this extra margin with negative margins.-->
        <h2 class="m-3">Example of Using Rows</h2>
        <div class="container">
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col">
                    <h4>This is Column One</h4>
                    <p>This is information that Column One has. This information would be more helpful if it had something more significant to say. But it does not.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col">
                    <h4>This is Column Two</h4>
                    <p>This is information that Column Two has. This information would be more helpful if it had something more significant to say. But it also does not.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col">
                    <h4>This is Column Three</h4>
                    <p>This is information that Column Three has. This information would be more helpful if it had something more significant to say. But it, as with the others, does not.</p>

                <div class="col">
                    <h4>A New Row, One Less Column</h4>
                    <p>This is all within the same div container, though it is a new row. Because it's within the same overall container, it continues to set up the rows in the same grid.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col">
                    <h4>But wait... What about the space?!</h4>
                    <p>This row only has two columns, whereas the previous one had three. As you can see, it does not matter if one row has more or less columns as another. The columns will evenly split the space and will take up the width of the overall container.</p>
