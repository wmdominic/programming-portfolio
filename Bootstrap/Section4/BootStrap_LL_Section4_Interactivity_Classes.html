            <p>Once upon a time, there were three little pigs. The pigs lived in a small house with their mum. One day, their mum sent them off to build houses of their own.</p>
            <p>As they walked down the road, the first little pig met a farmer pulling a cart of straw. It looked very warm - just right for building a house. He asked if he could have some. The farmer agreed and the first little pig began to build his straw house.</p>
            <p>A little way down the road, the second little pig saw a woodcutter with a cart of sticks. They looked thick and long - just right for building a house. He asked if he could have some. The woodcutter agreed and the second little pig began to build his wooden house.</p>
